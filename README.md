# GeoMapping with GeoPandas and Bokeh
Some random pieces of code for geomapping with geopandas and bokeh.

worldmap_geopandas-bokeh.ipynb takes the world data from geopandas, converts it to a bokeh-readable format and then plots it bokeh style.

Note that this needs some polishing so feel free to add suggestions.
